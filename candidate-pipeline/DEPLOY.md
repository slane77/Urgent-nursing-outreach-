# Deployment runbook — Candidate Pipeline

Stand the whole pipeline up **on an isolated Supabase dev branch first**, prove
it on synthetic data, then promote to production. Nothing here touches the
existing outreach system (it's a separate `candidate` schema).

> **Order matters.** Do the steps top to bottom. ☐ = tick as you go.

---

## 0. Before you start — gather

- ☐ **Anthropic API key** + confirm data-handling terms (DPA / no-training-by-default / zero-data-retention). *Use synthetic candidates on dev until this is signed off (§11).*
- ☐ **Brevo account** + API key (transactional email).
- ☐ A **sending domain/subdomain** you control (e.g. `candidates.daywebster.com`) for `From` and `Reply-To`.
- ☐ (Later) Indeed / Reed / CV-Library recruiter **API credentials**.

---

## 1. Create the dev environment

**Option A — Supabase Branching** (Pro plan): Dashboard → Branches → create branch `candidate-dev`. You get an isolated DB + its own URL/keys.
**Option B — a second free Supabase project** named `candidate-dev` as your sandbox.

☐ Note the dev project's **Project URL**, **anon (publishable) key**, and **service-role key**.

---

## 2. Apply the schema (in order)

In the dev project's **SQL Editor**, run each file in order:

☐ `sql/10_candidate_schema.sql`
☐ `sql/11_candidate_policies.sql`
☐ `sql/12_candidate_seed.sql`
☐ `sql/13_compliance_requirements.sql`
☐ `sql/14_early_warnings.sql`
☐ `sql/15_inbound_email.sql`
☐ `sql/16_sourcing.sql`
☐ `sql/17_dashboard.sql`
☐ `sql/18_desks.sql`

☐ **Expose the schema:** Settings → API → *Exposed schemas* → add `candidate`.
☐ **Storage:** create a **private** bucket named `candidate-docs`.

---

## 3. Set function secrets

In the dev project: Edge Functions → Secrets (or `supabase secrets set`). Set:

| Secret | Example / note |
|---|---|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | `sk-ant-…` |
| `BREVO_API_KEY` | from Brevo |
| `CANDIDATE_SENDER_EMAIL` | `candidates@candidates.daywebster.com` |
| `CANDIDATE_SENDER_NAME` | `Day Webster` |
| `REPLY_DOMAIN` | `candidates.daywebster.com` |
| `REPLY_LOCAL` | `compliance` |
| `INBOUND_SECRET` | any random string |
| `CRON_SECRET` | any random string |
| `PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | where `intake.html` is hosted (see step 6) |
| `ORG_NAME` / `ORG_URL` | `Day Webster` / `https://www.daywebster.com` |

`SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` are injected automatically — don't set them.

---

## 4. Deploy the edge functions

The functions import a shared folder, so deploy them with `_shared` alongside.
Place them under `supabase/functions/` like this (copy from
`candidate-pipeline/functions/`):

```
supabase/functions/_shared/{email.ts,jobposting.ts}
supabase/functions/candidate-agent/index.ts
supabase/functions/<each other function>/index.ts
```

Deploy (`supabase functions deploy <name>` for each, or the dashboard editor),
with these JWT settings:

| Function | verify_jwt | Who calls it |
|---|---|---|
| `candidate-agent` | **true** | staff (cockpit) |
| `csv-import` | **true** | staff (importer) |
| `reference-request` | **true** | staff |
| `job-advert` | **true** | staff (vacancies) |
| `outreach-campaign` | **true** | staff |
| `candidate-intake` | **false** | public form |
| `inbound-email` | **false** | email provider (`?secret=`) |
| `early-warnings` | **false** | cron (`?secret=`) |
| `jobs` | **false** | public (Google) |

---

## 5. Schedule + inbound

☐ **Cron:** schedule `early-warnings` daily — Dashboard → Cron, or pg_cron:
`select cron.schedule('early-warnings','0 8 * * *', $$ select net.http_post('https://<dev>.functions.supabase.co/early-warnings?secret=<CRON_SECRET>') $$);`
☐ **Inbound email:** in your email provider (Brevo Inbound Parsing / SendGrid
Inbound Parse / Mailgun Routes), point inbound to
`https://<dev>.functions.supabase.co/inbound-email?secret=<INBOUND_SECRET>` and
map its payload to `{from,to,subject,text,html,attachments[]}`.
☐ **Deliverability:** in Brevo, verify the sending domain and add **SPF, DKIM,
DMARC** records. Don't send volume until this is green.

---

## 6. Host the front-end (pointed at the dev branch)

The pages (`dashboard.html`, `candidates.html`, `vacancies.html`,
`candidate-import.html`, `intake.html`) are static and read `js/config.js`.

☐ For dev testing, set `js/config.js` to the **dev** project's URL + anon key
(keep a copy of the prod values). Set `PUBLIC_SITE_URL` (step 3) to wherever
these are served (Vercel preview, a dev Pages site, or even local `file://`
for the staff pages — though Storage/login work best over http).

---

## 6a. Desks & roles (co-pilot)

Visibility is **siloed by desk**. Until you populate `staff`, *everyone on an
authorised domain is treated as admin and sees all* (safe bootstrap). To switch
on siloing once people have logged in once (so they exist in `auth.users`):

```sql
-- 1. make yourself admin (see everything + the control tower)
insert into candidate.staff (user_id, full_name, is_admin)
select id, 'Scott Lane', true from auth.users where email = 'you@daywebster.com';

-- 2. add a recruiter to one or more desks (they then see only those desks)
insert into candidate.staff (user_id, is_admin)
select id, false from auth.users where email = 'recruiter@daywebster.com';
insert into candidate.desk_members (desk_id, user_id)
select dk.id, u.id from candidate.desks dk, auth.users u
where dk.code = 'theatres' and u.email = 'recruiter@daywebster.com';
```

Candidates **auto-route** to a desk on qualification (Theatres → Theatres desk,
ward/A&E/ITU/HCA/RMN → Nursing North/South by region, neonatal/paeds →
Midwifery, ANP/ENP → Primary Care, etc.). Anything that can't be matched stays
**Unrouted** and shows in the dashboard + the cockpit's "Unassigned (to route)"
filter for an admin to place. (North/South routing needs the candidate's
`region` to read "North"/"South" — normalise region for full auto-split, or
route those manually for now.)

A desk-admin UI (manage staff, desk membership, coverage) is a later increment;
for now use the SQL above.

---

## 7. Smoke test (synthetic data only)

Work through the loop and watch the **dashboard** populate:

1. ☐ Open `intake.html` → register a fake candidate → appears in `candidates.html` as `sourced`.
2. ☐ In the cockpit, open them → **Run agent** → it replies + fills fields + requests docs.
3. ☐ `candidate-import.html` → import a tiny synthetic spreadsheet → rows land as `sourced`, deduped.
4. ☐ `vacancies.html` → create a vacancy → advert generates → open the public **jobs** page (`/functions/v1/jobs?slug=…`) and check it renders + has JSON-LD (view source).
5. ☐ Cockpit → send a **reference request** (via `reference-request`) to a test inbox; reply to it; confirm `inbound-email` ingests it and it shows in the review queue.
6. ☐ Manually hit `early-warnings?secret=…` → check it returns counts.
7. ☐ Run an `outreach-campaign` (referral/reengagement) against the synthetic bench.
8. ☐ Dashboard: KPIs, funnel, intake-by-channel, campaign cost-per-candidate, activity feed all populate.

Validate JSON-LD at search.google.com/test/rich-results before relying on Google for Jobs.

---

## 8. Promote to production

When dev is proven and the §11 terms are signed off:

1. ☐ Run `sql/10 → 18` on the **production** project (or merge the branch).
2. ☐ Expose `candidate` schema; create the `candidate-docs` bucket.
3. ☐ Set the same secrets with **production** values.
4. ☐ Deploy the functions to production; schedule cron; point the inbound webhook.
5. ☐ Restore `js/config.js` to production URL/anon key; set `PUBLIC_SITE_URL` to the live host.
6. ☐ Go live with inbound + Google for Jobs first; turn on paid channels once connectors + budgets are set.

---

## Rollback

Everything is additive and isolated. To remove it entirely:
`drop schema candidate cascade;` (dev), delete the functions, delete the
`candidate-docs` bucket. The outreach system is untouched throughout.
